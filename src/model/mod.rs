/// up over the files first, b1 = 1, c1 = 2, ... and then the
/// ranks, a2 = 8, a3 = 16, ... ending with h8 = 63.

/// This '64' numbering scheme is chosen rather than the '0x88'
/// numbering scheme because `catchesstropy` uses a bitboard

/// 0-63 are useful in bit arithmetic and in array indexing.

/// (The alternative '0x88' numbering scheme is more useful
/// in certain mailbox representations (see [`mailbox`].)
/// In that scheme the rank and file of a square
/// are contained in separate nibbles of a byte, but that is
/// not implemented in this crate.)
